# Aleksander Gregersen

Junior DevOps Engineer building reliable cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and observable platforms.

- I like: Infrastructure as Code, container platforms, automation, and pragmatic monitoring
- Currently: improving Kubernetes + platform operations, and hardening CI/CD with quality gates
- Open to: platform/devops work where reliability and developer experience matter
