# Aleksander Gregersen

Junior DevOps Engineer building reliable cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and observable platforms.

- I like: Infrastructure as Code, container platforms, automation, and pragmatic monitoring
- Currently: improving Kubernetes + platform operations, and hardening CI/CD with quality gates
- Open to: platform/devops work where reliability and developer experience matter

- **Deployments & CI/CD:** build/test pipelines, container image workflows, and automated releases
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform/Ansible for reproducible environments and consistent server configuration
- **Observability:** metrics + logs + dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki) with actionable signals
- **Platform:** Docker/Kubernetes, reverse proxies, service networking, and runtime reliability
